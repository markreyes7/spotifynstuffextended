This project is an extenison of the scripts written in my Spotifynstuff repository. I intend to create a simple UI to make the playlist and imports of song be onscreen. It is clear that spotify is far more advanced when it comes to this UI yet I believe this displays my skillset and extends my knowledge of back end and front end development. 

The project will further be expanded to collect songs as they are and not let the current spotify algorithim overtake my listening experience. I find that when collecting data and displaying data in this project, the same songs and artists appear. I understand my music taste may be similar but there are tracks that go missing in my daily music lists due to the fact that the current spotify algorithim tends to display the same songs.
